# tmdb_movie_analysis


## Introduction
As part of my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree, the first project was to look at a dataset from Kaggle of movies, with the intention of drawing insights as well as visualisations.

## Data Used
For this analysis, the tmdb.csv contains all the data needed for the analysis.
